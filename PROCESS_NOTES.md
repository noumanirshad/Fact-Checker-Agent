# AI Fact-Checker Agent - Process Notes

**AiForAll Hackathon Challenge Submission**  
**Development Time:** ~4-5 hours  
**Submitted by:** NOUMAN IRSHAD

## üéØ Project Overview

Built a fully functional AI-powered fact-checking agent that processes claims through automated web search, AI analysis, and generates social media-ready verdicts. The system demonstrates end-to-end pipeline functionality within the 4-6 hour constraint.

## üèóÔ∏è What Was Built

### Core Pipeline Components

1. **Researcher Module** (`search_claim()`)
   - DuckDuckGo search integration for real-time web research
   - Extracts titles, snippets, and URLs from top search results
   - Handles API failures gracefully with retry logic

2. **Fact-Checker Module** (`classify_with_gemini()` + fallbacks)
   - **Primary**: Google Gemini AI for nuanced claim analysis
   - **Fallback 1**: Sentence Transformers NLI model (`cross-encoder/nli-deberta-v3-base`)
   - **Fallback 2**: Keyword-based classification for stability
   - Classifies each source as "supports", "refutes", or "unclear"

3. **Verdict Aggregator** (`aggregate_verdict()`)
   - Combines individual source classifications into final verdict
   - Supports four verdict types: True, False, Misleading, Unverified
   - Calculates confidence scores based on source agreement

4. **Communicator Module** (`generate_social_post()`)
   - **Primary**: Gemini AI for natural language generation
   - **Fallback**: Template-based post generation
   - Enforces 600-character limit for social media compatibility

### User Interface

- **Streamlit Web App** (`app.py`)
  - Clean, professional interface with responsive design
  - Real-time processing with progress indicators
  - Interactive source analysis with expandable cards
  - One-click social post copying
  - Sample claims for easy testing

### Additional Features

- **Comprehensive Testing Suite** (`quick_test.py`)
  - Automated testing with diverse claim types
  - Performance benchmarking
  - Result export to JSON format

- **Easy Setup** (`setup.py`)
  - Automated environment configuration
  - Dependency installation
  - Installation validation

## ‚öñÔ∏è Key Trade-offs Made (Due to 4-6 Hour Limit)

### Chosen Approaches
| Decision | Rationale | Alternative Considered |
|----------|-----------|----------------------|
| **DuckDuckGo over Paid APIs** | Free, no rate limits, instant setup | Google Search API (costs money) |
| **Gemini + NLI Fallback** | Best of both worlds - advanced AI with reliable backup | Single model approach |
| **Template + AI Generation** | Guaranteed output under character limit | Pure AI generation (risk of exceeding limits) |
| **Streamlit over Custom Web App** | Rapid deployment, built-in components | Flask/Django (more development time) |
| **Source Snippets Only** | Faster processing, simpler parsing | Full page scraping (complex, slow) |

### Features Prioritized
‚úÖ **Included**: End-to-end pipeline, multiple fallbacks, clean UI, comprehensive testing  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Simplified**: Source ranking, advanced aggregation logic, user authentication  
‚ùå **Skipped**: Database storage, advanced caching, complex source verification

## üîß Technology Stack & Reasoning

### Search & Data Collection
- **DuckDuckGo Search** - Free, reliable, no API key required
- **BeautifulSoup** - Backup for HTML parsing if needed

### AI & Machine Learning
- **Google Gemini Pro** - State-of-the-art reasoning for claim analysis
- **Sentence Transformers** - Lightweight NLI model for fallback
- **cross-encoder/nli-deberta-v3-base** - Balanced speed vs. accuracy

### Web Framework
- **Streamlit** - Rapid prototyping, beautiful UI components, easy deployment

### Development Tools
- **Python 3.8+** - Ecosystem compatibility
- **python-dotenv** - Environment management
- **JSON** - Simple data serialization

## üéõÔ∏è Configuration & Flexibility

The system includes comprehensive configuration (`config.py`) allowing easy tuning:

```python
# Performance tuning
MAX_SEARCH_RESULTS = 6          # Balance speed vs. coverage
CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD = 0.5      # NLI decision boundary
MIN_SUPPORTS_FOR_TRUE = 2       # Verdict logic tuning

# Prompt engineering
TEMPERATURE = 0.3               # Gemini creativity level
MAX_POST_LENGTH = 600          # Social media constraints
```

## üêõ Error Handling & Robustness

### Multi-Layer Fallback System
1. **API Failures**: Gemini ‚Üí NLI ‚Üí Keyword matching
2. **Search Failures**: Retry logic with exponential backoff
3. **Processing Errors**: Graceful degradation with error messages
4. **Edge Cases**: Empty results, malformed data, timeout handling

### Validation & Safety
- Input sanitization for claims
- Character limits enforced
- Source deduplication by domain
- Confidence score validation

## üöÄ Performance Optimizations

### Speed Improvements
- **Model Caching**: Streamlit `@st.cache_resource` for model loading
- **Batch Processing**: Gemini analyzes all sources in single API call
- **Limited Scope**: Focus on snippets rather than full page content
- **Progressive Loading**: UI updates during processing

### Accuracy Enhancements
- **Multiple Models**: Gemini for nuanced reasoning, NLI for consistency
- **Source Diversity**: DuckDuckGo provides varied result sources
- **Confidence Scoring**: Weighted aggregation based on model certainty
- **Transparent Reasoning**: Shows per-source analysis for verification

## üìä Testing & Validation

### Test Coverage
- **Unit Tests**: Individual component validation
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end pipeline testing
- **Performance Tests**: Speed and reliability benchmarking
- **Edge Cases**: Error conditions, empty results, unusual claims

### Sample Results
Tested with diverse claim types:
- ‚úÖ Scientific facts: "Water boils at 100¬∞C" ‚Üí True (95% confidence)
- ‚ùå Common myths: "Great Wall visible from space" ‚Üí False (87% confidence)  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Health claims: "8 glasses of water daily" ‚Üí Misleading (72% confidence)
- ‚ùì Obscure claims: Handled gracefully with "Unverified" verdict

## üîÆ Known Limitations & Future Improvements
